# Mood Journal Application

### Work In Progress

This is a mood journal application, customised for Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). 
It creates an entry everyday that can be filled in at any time. 
Each entry captures metrics for emotions configured in the app. (This will be customizable soon) 
It also has a Skill section where you can select skills that you used during the day.
It will have an export function soon, because that's the whole reason I wrote this 
-- to be able to fill and export easily.
